JAVASCRIPT

1. Numbers and Math
- can write the JS code in the browser's console(F12)
- alert('hello');	//alert messages pops up
- document.body.innerHTML = 'hello'	//changes the body of the page into what you write
- Math in JS follows the BODMAS rule(order of operations)
- while doing math with the money better to do it in cents/paisa because it causes some error when dealing with floating numbers
- 10% cannot be used instead use *0.1 while doing Math

2.String
- String and Numbers can be concatenated - Type coercion(automatic type conversion)
- typeof 'hello' or 4 gives what datatype it is.
- JS adds form left to right
- String can be written in 'hello', "hello", `hello`
- `string` it is called as Template Strings. 
	Functions:

	1. It has Interpolation = insert a value directly in a string.${}
		for eg: items(${1+1}) = out put will be items(2)
	2. MultiLineString:
		`DhanushGR
		 ISE`

3. HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- The notes of HTML and CSS is in another repository
- The JS can be embedded in HTML file in the body element
- It should be always at the end of the body element before it ends, it's a good practice in general.(Let's the web page to load first and then loads the js code for interactive).
- The JS element should is <script>

4. booleans, comparisons
- true and false without any ''.
- normally == is used in other languages, but in JS === is used instead of == to compare the values
- === compares thhe value 
- == converts both the value to one type and then checks it.
- use !== instead of != 

For eg: 5 == '5.00' (this converts the string into number and then compares both of them)
		true

		5 === '5.00'
		false

		5 === 5
		true


if(true){}
if(false){} ==> This can be take the values of:
				false, 0, '', NaN, Undefined, null
if(false, 0, '', NaN, Undefined, null) ==> this runs as if it is false.
All the value other than this are true.
