        consider cartQuantity, if it is 0, then it comes under falsy value
        id it is 1 or above, it comes under truthy value.

        you don't have to explicitly say that  if(cartQuantity > 0) like we used to do it in Java.
        you can just write  if(cartQuantity) and it checks the value of it and do the operation.
